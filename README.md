Yet another alliance manager (for galaxywars browser game).

## Status
This script was written about 2002 for php4 with almost no knowledge about
proper coding standars.
For those who are interested how improper php code looked in 2002, I put
these scripts under the apache 2.0 licence.

## Development
There is no active development. However, I prepared a composer file and a
phpunit setup for php5.4.\* and php5.5.\*.

If you care to send pull requests, be sure to follow psr coding standards.
And please add some PHPUnit tests.
Also, let's get rid of smarty and php4 code.
